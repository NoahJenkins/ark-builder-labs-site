# Blog Posts

This directory contains MDX blog posts for the Ark Builder Labs website.

## Creating a New Blog Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory
2. Add the required frontmatter at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
category: "Web Development" # or "Cloud Engineering", "AI Consulting", etc.
publishedAt: "2024-08-30" # YYYY-MM-DD format
readTime: "5 min read"
featured: false # Set to true to feature on the blog homepage
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown/MDX syntax
4. The blog system will automatically:
   - Generate the URL based on the filename (e.g., `my-post.mdx` â†’ `/blog/my-post`)
   - Display the post on the blog listing page
   - Handle proper SEO metadata
