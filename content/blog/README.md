# Blog Posts

This directory contains MDX blog posts for the Ark Builder Labs website.

## Creating a New Blog Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory
2. Add the required frontmatter at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
category: "Web Development" # or "Cloud Engineering", "AI Consulting", etc.
publishedAt: "2024-08-30" # YYYY-MM-DD format
readTime: "5 min read"
featured: false # Set to true to feature on the blog homepage
image: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg" # Optional: path to blog post image
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown/MDX syntax
4. The blog system will automatically:
   - Generate the URL based on the filename (e.g., `my-post.mdx` â†’ `/blog/my-post`)
   - Display the post on the blog listing page
   - Handle proper SEO metadata

## Supported Frontmatter Fields

- `title` (required): The post title
- `excerpt` (required): Brief description for the blog listing

- `publishedAt` (required): Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `readTime` (optional): Estimated reading time, defaults to "5 min read"
- `featured` (optional): Whether to feature the post, defaults to false
- `image` (optional): Path to blog post image, replaces emoji placeholder

## MDX Features

- Headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Paragraphs and lists

## Adding Images to Blog Posts

### Method 1: Frontmatter Image (Recommended)

Add an `image` field to your post's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Blog Post"
image: "/assets/images/blog/my-post-hero.jpg"
---
```

**Image Requirements:**
- Place images in `/public/assets/images/blog/` directory
- Recommended size: 1200x630px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- File size: Keep under 500KB for best performance

### Method 2: Images Within Content

You can also add images directly in your MDX content:

```mdx
![Alt text](/assets/images/blog/content-image.jpg)

# Or using Next.js Image component
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image 
  src="/assets/images/blog/content-image.jpg" 
  alt="Description" 
  width={600} 
  height={400} 
/>
```
